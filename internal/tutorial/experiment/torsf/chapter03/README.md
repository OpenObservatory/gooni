# Chapter III: starting to simulate a real torsf experiment

In this chapter we will improve upon what we did in the previous
chapter by creating runner code for the `torsf` experiment. We will
not, yet, run the real experiment, but we will instead write
simple code that pretends to run a `tor` bootstrap using snowflake.
